{"ratingQuestions":[{"identifier":"BI","category":"Coverage","fieldLabel":"Bodily Injury","fieldType":"Slider","fieldLength":"","required":"Y","tooltip":"Applies when other people are injured by your car and you or another insured person is at-fault; provides for your legal defense if injury claims or lawsuits are brought against you, subject to your policy limits.<br><br>Example: Your current Bodily Injury limits are $50,000/$100,000. This means that the maximum amount covered for injury to any one person is $50,000 and the maximum amount covered per occurrence is $100,000. This pays for the other party’s medical bills, loss of wages, and pain and suffering. So if you’re in an at-fault accident with a vehicle and the total medical and ambulance bills, loss of wages, and pain and suffering come to $45,000, your policy would protect you 100% for the bodily injury claim. However, if you are involved in a more serious accident, with more than one vehicle for instance, and the total liability damage comes to $200,000, you could be liable to pay the amount above your policy limits. This could put all of your assets and earnings at risk.<br><br>*Distribution represents auto insurance policyholders with the AAA Texas as of 06/30/2016.","displayOrder":"1","hasAdditional":"false","options":[{"description":"30000/60000","code":"30000/60000"},{"description":"50000/100000","code":"50000/100000"},{"description":"100000/300000","code":"100000/300000"},{"description":"250000/500000","code":"250000/500000"},{"description":"300000/300000","code":"300000/300000"},{"description":"500000/500000","code":"500000/500000"},{"description":"500000/1000000","code":"500000/1000000"},{"description":"1000000/1000000","code":"1000000/1000000"}]},{"identifier":"PD","category":"Coverage","fieldLabel":"Property Damage","fieldType":"Slider","fieldLength":"","required":"Y","tooltip":"Applies if you or another insured person damages someone else's property such as a vehicle, lamppost, or building, up to the limit you choose and your legal defense.<br><br>Example: Your current Property Damage limit is $50,000.
